# Specialization-TT
A collection of Machine Learning algorithm implementations in Python using libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Covers Regression, Classification, Clustering, and Reinforcement Learning with practical datasets like Titanic, Boston Housing, Iris, and Mall Customers.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encoding, scaling, normalization, and feature selection.
Regression Algorithms: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression, and evaluation using RMSE, R², and MSE.
Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
Evaluation & Visualization: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, learning curves, feature importance, cluster visualization.
Reinforcement Learning: Basic Q-Learning implementations on grid-based environments.

#Datasets

Projects use real-world structured datasets, including:
Titanic Survival Dataset
Boston Housing Dataset
Iris Flower Dataset
Adult Census Dataset
Mall Customer Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset

 # Highlights

End-to-end ML workflow: data exploration → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → visualization.
Focus on practical understanding and experimentation with Python ML libraries.
Suitable for beginners to intermediate learners wanting to strengthen ML skills.
